- Domain Driven

### GraphQL

- Query language for APIs 
- Single endpoint
- JSON-like syntax

### Serverless Architecture
Without Needign to have a server machine

Backend ( or Modules ) as a function ( service ) with less infrastructure to manage

 e.g Lambda & Netlify

### API-First Design

develop the api before building the product on top of it

### Machine Learning 
Using e.g Tensorflow.js 

- User behavior
- Recommendation
- Security Alerts

Definition of Done ? 

### Use APIs 
As a ready-made services

- Speech, Vision

### Development  Tools
- GIT for source version control 
- Browser Dev. Tools
- VSCode Extensions
- NPM or Yarn for package management

- Emmet
- Axios
- Webpack or Pracel ( JS Module bundlers )
- JS infra  CLI/ NPM / webpack / babel


### New 
- Web Assembly :
- PWA : Regular web app but have a native feel as far as experience, layout and functionality
 Must be HHTPS
 Installable
 Relaible, fast, engaging
 Splash screen
 Look great on all screen sizes
- JAMstack : JS, API & Markup ,,, high performance, generated at deploy time, easy to scale and host
- Static site generator
- Server-side rendering
- Svelte : JS compiler producing vanilla and simplify building interfaces
No virtual DOM, fast & less code

- State management for large apps ( e.g Redux, Context API with hooks )
